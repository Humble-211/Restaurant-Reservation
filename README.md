Certainly! Here’s a detailed project outline for building a Restaurant Reservation Web App. As a professor, I will guide you through the objectives, requirements, and key milestones you should aim for.

Project Title: Restaurant Reservation Web Application

Objective:

The goal of this project is to design and develop a fully functional web application where users can book tables at a restaurant. The application will handle user authentication, restaurant table management, and reservation scheduling.

Project Milestones:

1. Requirements Gathering

Before starting development, outline the requirements:

	•	User Requirements:
	•	Users should be able to create an account and log in.
	•	Users can browse restaurant availability.
	•	Users can book a table for a specific time and date.
	•	Admin Requirements:
	•	Restaurant admin can manage table availability.
	•	Admin can view, edit, or cancel reservations.

2. System Design

	•	Database Design:
	•	Define entities like Users, Reservations, Tables, Restaurants.
	•	Create an ER (Entity-Relationship) diagram that models relationships among these entities.
	•	Frontend Design:
	•	Plan UI/UX using wireframes. Use tools like Figma or Balsamiq to design the flow for pages like login, reservation, and confirmation.
	•	The app should be mobile-responsive.
	•	Backend Design:
	•	Choose a technology stack (e.g., MERN Stack: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js).
	•	Define RESTful API endpoints, e.g., /reservations, /users, /tables.

3. Development

	•	Frontend (Client-side):
	•	Implement a user-friendly interface using React (or your preferred front-end framework).
	•	Build forms for login, signup, reservation search, and confirmation.
	•	Handle form validations (e.g., date and time selection).
	•	Backend (Server-side):
	•	Implement a REST API using Express.js (or your preferred backend framework).
	•	Connect the API with a database like MongoDB or MySQL for storing reservation data.
	•	Create authentication (JWT-based) for user and admin roles.
	•	Database:
	•	Use a database management system (DBMS) like MongoDB or PostgreSQL.
	•	Implement schema and database models for tables, users, reservations, etc.

4. Core Features to Implement:

	•	User Authentication:
	•	Registration, login, and password management.
	•	Role-based access control (e.g., Admin vs. regular users).
	•	Reservation System:
	•	Table Availability: Show available time slots for specific dates.
	•	Booking: Allow users to book a table and receive confirmation.
	•	View/Cancel Reservations: Users should be able to see or cancel upcoming reservations.
	•	Admin Panel:
	•	Admin can manage the number of tables and time slots.
	•	Admin can view all reservations in a calendar or list view.

5. Testing:

	•	Write unit tests for your backend API using Jest or Mocha.
	•	Perform frontend testing using tools like Cypress for end-to-end tests.
	•	Ensure responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

6. Deployment:

	•	Deploy the web app on platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify.
	•	Use CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployments.
	•	Setup a cloud database service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas) for remote access to the DB.

Bonus Features (Optional):

	•	Email Notifications: Automatically send booking confirmation and reminder emails.
	•	Google Maps Integration: Show the restaurant’s location on the map.
	•	Reviews System: Allow users to rate and review their reservation experience.
	•	Payment Integration: Add a feature for users to pay a deposit or full payment when making a reservation.

Tech Stack (Suggestion):

	•	Frontend: React.js, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS
	•	Backend: Node.js, Express.js
	•	Database: MongoDB (or SQL-based DB like PostgreSQL)
	•	Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
	•	Deployment: Heroku or Netlify (Frontend), MongoDB Atlas (Database)

Deliverables:

	•	Fully functioning web app with source code hosted on GitHub.
	•	Documentation including setup instructions, API documentation, and user manual.
	•	Demonstration video showing key functionalities.

Grading Criteria:

	•	Functionality: The app should meet all core features.
	•	Code Quality: Clean, well-structured, and documented code.
	•	UI/UX: User-friendly, responsive, and visually appealing interface.
	•	Testing: Coverage of key features with proper testing.
	•	Deployment: Successful deployment and accessibility online.
